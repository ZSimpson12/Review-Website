Personal Project - Personal review website
Description of code: For this project I used templates to create the movie detail pages. I found that this is a much easier solution and allows for scalability than creating individual pages for each movie. 
To run: clone repo and open in IDE, in terminal run "python app.py", next open local host "http://localhost:5000" .Click on posters to see reviews. 
*Currently only Strange Magic, Call me by your name, and Girlfight work*
